# This is a recreation of the classic Pong game made using the [Raylib Library](https://www.raylib.com/) and C++.
### I made this game to understand the basic concepts of mathematics and physics used in game development like 2 -Dimensional movement, collision detections, shapes and their limitations. 

# How to Install:

1. Download and Install [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/tag/5.0) depending on your operating system. Instructions available in the [raylib official documentation](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).
2. Once raylib has been set up in your environment, you can execute the [exec](https://github.com/Rohxn16/pong/blob/main/exec.bat) file. If you are on a mac or linux system, change the extension from .bat to .bash and execute it.
3. Once a .out or .exe file has been generated it can be run to execute the game
4. If you are on windows and want to directly play the game without any installations, you can just download the  that I have uploaded [here](https://github.com/Rohxn16/pong/blob/main/output.exe).
